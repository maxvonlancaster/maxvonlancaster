                <li><b>Game of Life</b>  
                    <br>Description: The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British
                    mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
                    The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1)
                    or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
                    using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
                    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
                    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
                    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
                    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
                    The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where
                    births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

                    An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.

                    Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
                    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

                    <br>Description: Given a string expression representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.
                    The final result should be an irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.

                <li><b>Valid Square</b>  
                    <br>Description: Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space p1, p2, p3 and p4, return true if the four points construct a square.
                    The coordinate of a point pi is represented as [xi, yi]. The input is not given in any order.
                    A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).

                <li><b>Contiguous Array</b> 
                    <br>Description: Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

                <li><b>Palindromic Substrings</b> 
                    <br>Description: Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
                    A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
                    A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
                </li>
            
                <li><b> Solve the Equation</b>
                    <br>Description: Solve a given equation and return the value of 'x' in the form of a string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable 'x' and its coefficient. You should return "No solution" if there is no solution for the equation, or "Infinite solutions" if there are infinite solutions for the equation.
                    If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of 'x' is an integer.
                    <br>Input: equation = "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
                    <br>Output: "x=2"

                <li><b>Valid Triangle Number</b> 
                    <br>Description: Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.
                </li>
            
                <li><b>Sum of Square Numbers</b> 
                    <br>Description: Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.
                </li>
            
                <li><b>Rabbits in Forest</b> 
                    <br>Description: There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.
                    Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
