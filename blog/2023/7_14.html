            <h3>Basics</h3>
            <p>Base LLM - Predicts next word, based on text training data.</p>
            <p>Instruction Tuned LLM- Fine-tuned on instructions and attempts at following those instructions;</p>
            <p>RLHF: reinforced Learning with Human Feedback.</p> 
            <p>Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions</p>
            <p>Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”</p>


            <h3>Prerequisits for usage</h3>
            <p>We will be using Python (I used 3.10), pip.</p>
            <p>Install the following libraries:</p>

            <pre><code>
pip install openai
pip install IPython
            </code></pre>

            <p>Get your api key from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys</a>, and set it up this way:</p>
            <pre><code>
import openai
openai.api_key = "your key goes here"
            </code></pre>

            <p>This method you can use to call ChatGPT api with your prompts:</p>
            <pre><code>
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, <span style="color: green;"># this is the degree of randomness of the model's output</span>
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
            </code></pre>

            <p>Now try this:</p>
            <pre><code>
print(get_completion("Describe a plot of the movie 'Star Trek' written by Quentin Tarantino. Write it in bulletpoints by plot points from start to finish. Describe the ending in details"))
            </code></pre>


            <h3>Tactics</h3>
            <p>The following tactics will help you in your usage of ChatGPT for development:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
                    Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, &lt; &gt;, &lt; tag &gt; &lt; /tag &gt;, :</li>
                <li>Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
                    JSON, HTML</li>
                <li>Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied</li>
                <li>Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
                    Give succesfull examples of completing tasks, then ask the model to perform the task;</li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code>
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.

            <h3>Principles</h3>
            <p>Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”</p> 
            <p>- Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
                Ask for output in a specified format</p>
            <p>- Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
                Note that the student's solution is actually not correct.
                We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.</p>

To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \

Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:

I'm building a solar power installation and I need help \

- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot

me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \

What is the total cost for the first year of operations \

Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:

2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
